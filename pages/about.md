## About the Collection  


## About the Staff  
This CollectionBuilder was assembled by Kathryn Bullock. Bullock is currently a MLS student specializing in archives and records management at Indiana University. She is a former elementary teacher with experience in curriculum development for upper elementary. Her interest in history and archives inspired her to pursue the presidential campaign of Robert F. Kennedy. When she is not working on schoolwork or her job at the library, she enjoys reading, knitting, and baking.

## Acknowledgments  
I would like to first thank Katie Morrison and the University Archives at Indiana University for procuring the materials from their collection that were displayed in this site. In addition, I thank Dr. John Walsh and Gyuri Kang for teaching my class about CollectionBuilder and GitHub, and their patience with my questions and confusion in figuring it out. Finally, I thank Sally A. Lied for her donation of this collection and several other artifacts. With it, I wouldnâ€™t have been able to learn so much about Robert F. Kennedy or the Kennedy family.
